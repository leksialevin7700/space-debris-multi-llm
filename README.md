# AI space debris multi llm

## Overview

A multi-LLM, physics-augmented system designed to predict and mitigate satelliteâ€“debris collisions in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). This project integrates orbital mechanics with AI heuristics and LLM-based explanations to provide early warnings, risk assessment, and recommended avoidance maneuvers.


## Features

| Component                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Orbit Intelligence Engine (Model A)     | Fetches Two-Line Element (TLE) data from public sources, propagates satellite orbits using sgp4, and constructs a semantic graph of satellites and debris (nodes = objects, edges = potential conjunctions). |
| Collision Risk Predictor (Model B)      | Uses graph heuristics (placeholder for GNN) to compute risk scores for each potential collision and provides textual explanations.                                                                           |
| Multi-LLM Negotiation Planner (Model C) | Proposes optimal avoidance maneuvers based on satellite traffic, delta-v minimization, and collision risk.                                                                                                   |
| Mission Report Generator (Model D)      | Generates detailed HTML/PDF reports for engineers and mission control, summarizing collision risks and recommended maneuvers.                                                                                |
| FastAPI backend                         | API endpoints for running the full pipeline (/run_pipeline) and fetching reports (/report).                        

## Technical Implementation

### Model A: Orbit Intelligence Engine

* Fetches TLEs from Celestrak URLs.
* Converts TLEs to `Satrec` objects from `sgp4`.
* Propagates satellite positions over time.
* Builds a NetworkX semantic graph where:

  * Nodes represent satellites with TLE attributes.
  * Edges represent potential close approaches, storing minimum distance.

### Model B: Collision Risk Predictor

* Computes a heuristic risk score per edge based on:

  * Minimum distance between satellites.
  * Node degree (satellite traffic).
* Generates textual explanations for each edge.
* Placeholder for future Graph Neural Network integration.

### Model C: Multi-LLM Negotiation Planner

* Simplified prototype uses heuristic to select satellite for maneuver based on traffic degree and distance.
* Computes recommended delta-v to avoid collisions.
* Consensus module picks the maneuver with the lowest delta-v.

### Model D: Mission Report Generator

* Uses Jinja2 templates to create an HTML report.
* Optional PDF generation via `pdfkit`.
* Includes all edges with risk scores, explanations, and maneuver recommendations.
